Welcome to the user Manual for the Preprocessor created by Jordi Justicia, Telmo Linacisoro, Paula Ceprián, Roger Sola, Maheen Assad and Gonzalo Fuentes.
To call the preprocessor first call the ppmakefile using the command "./ppmakefile" twice in the directory with the files from the preprocessor. Then you can call the preprocessor using "./preprocessor" and adding later the different arguments to perform certain actions.
An example would be "./preprocessor -c -d yourcode.c". 
If no c file is provided to the preprocessor, all flags except -help will be ignored, and an error message will show in the console.
The arguments are:
 -c     , to delete all comments
 -d     , to process all directives
 -all   , to delete all comments and process all directives
 -help  , to show the user manual 
Any number of arguments can be added to the command and all of them will do their associated function except if the argument -help was added, which will cancel all other commands and display the user manual, the current .txt that you are reading.s.
For more information about the flags read next:
-c will search for any comments after two slashes “//” or between slash asterisks “/* */” and deletes it from the main code.
-d will search for the different directives after the #: constants, includes, macros, defines and ifdefs. For each case the code will to the following:
Constants defined present in the code will be substituted by their respective values. 
Macros will be changed by their equivalent functions in c language. 
Includes will be changed by all the code from the file they reference.
IfDefs will remain or be eliminated depending on if the statement after them is defined on the code.
-all will call all functions before specified on -c and -d flags simultaneously.
-help will ignore all other flags and print this manual as stated earlier in the console.
